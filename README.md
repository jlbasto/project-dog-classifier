# Dog classification

## Project briefing

It is a CNN that addresses the classification of the dog breed, made in the Udacity's nanodegree. Given the image of a dog or a human, it classifies the type of animal it is and if a dog is recognized, it tries to determine which breed it belongs to.

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/jlbasto/project-dog-classifier.git
    ```

2.  This repository doesn't include any dataset you need. You can check out the procedure in the notebook to how to download them.


## Use a GPU for the training process

Using a GPU instead of a CPU, will speed up your training development and the project overall. But be careful, if you don't have one on your computer, you can use one from Amazon or Google. Some of them are free others are not.
